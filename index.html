                Welcome to fxrezful's website! There is pretty much nothing to see here but good job finding this.
                I mostly made this website to learn new languages (HTML, javascript) but this ended up being a pretty fun project.
                This page is just funny long text that you don't have to read unless you are obsessed with me so yeah you can skip to <a href="me.html">My Works</a> or <a href="chess.html">Chess</a>
            </p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p align="justify">
                You might know me from <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6311279644/TRIA-os-MAP-FIXES">TRIA.os</a>, an amazing ROBLOX game I enjoy a lot, 
                I've been stuck in this hell hole of making maps for ROBLOX flood escaping games for 3 years now,
                starting from Flood Escape 2 back in 2020 where I really got into Roblox Studio, and learnt the basics of building and scripting. 
                Due to poor motivation, I did not release any <em>real</em> maps in this game despite having started dozens of maps. <br><br>

                In march 2021,
                I moved on to making maps for TRIA.os because of Roblox's new audio update which made audios only usable in the experiences they were published to,
                TRIA.os made a system to get around that by manually verifying audios submitted in a special channel in their Discord server, 
                which is why I moved to TRIA.os. <br><br>

                At the start of 2022,
                I had joined the Nightlife Devs and participated in the creation of EndZone with Marchionne, Kris, Alex28901, Literal_Cow and MalachiLeapYear,
                which took over 7 months to create and is currently one of the most difficult TRIA.os maps at the moment, 
                this is where I started to get known around the community.
                I continued to create and help creating maps from mid 2022 to start of 2023,
                which you might have heard of:
                Reaver, The Sin, Moonlight Cosmos, Vivid, Vacuus and Dystopian World, collaborating with big creators such as Enszo, Svilar and more. <br> <br>

                At the moment I am currently trying to make a game while also trying all sorts of stuff just like making a website.

            <p>I don't really care about this website so you can go ahead and copy some code from here or even the whole thing, I don't really care.</p>
